 * This instruction transfers program control to a return address located on the top of the stack. The
 * address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction, and the return is made to the
 * instruction that follows the CALL instruction.
 * 
 * The optional source operand specifies the number of stack bytes to be released after the return
 * address is popped; the default is none. This operand can be used to release parameters from the
 * stack that were passed to the called procedure and are no longer needed.
